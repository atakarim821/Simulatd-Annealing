# Simulatd-Annealing
Implementation of Simulated Annealing, a stochastic global search optimization algorithm
  +Used Simulated Annealing technique to solve the NP complete travelling salesman problem. Estimated the mimimum distance required to visit all the cities whose locations are given in the cartesian coordinate system.
  +I used simulated Annealing technique to stochastically find the optimum (global minimum) point of a function.
