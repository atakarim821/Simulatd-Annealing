# Travelling Salesman Problem and Gradient Descent using Simulated Annealing
Implementation of Simulated Annealing, a stochastic global search optimization algorithm. It was a part of Assignment given in EE2703- Applied Programming Lab course 

>Used Simulated Annealing technique to solve famous Travelling Salesman Problem, a NP complete problem. I have animated the search of minimum path using FuncAnimation, a matplotlib method. I have taken two examples (see Assignment7b.py)
>+ with 10 cities
>+ with 100 cities

Also used Simulated Annealing to stochastically estimate the global optimum point of a function (see Assighnment7a.py).
