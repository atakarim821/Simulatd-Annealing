# Simulatd-Annealing
Implementation of Simulated Annealing, a stochastic global search optimization algorithm-

>Used Simulated Annealing technique to solve famous Travelling Salesman Problem, a NP complete problem. I have animated the search of minimum path using FuncAnimation, a matplotlib method. I have taken two examples-
>+ with 10 cities
>+ with 100 cities

Also used Simulated Annealing to stochastically estimate the global optimum point of a function.
